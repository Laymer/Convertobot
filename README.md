## Features

    * Try ``My car is `3 meters` long``
 * Queries WolframAlpha with `=<query>`
    *This will only show the primary pod of the WolframAlpha result, to not spam the channel.
    * Try `` `=image of obama` ``
 * Shows all the pods WolframAlpha gives us when you use =+
    * Try `` `=+solve (x*8 + 3) = 0` ``
 * Slash-Command /convert
    * `/convert <unit expression>` converts metric to imperial or vice versa in the same style the ` unit expression would
       * Try `/convert 3 meters`
    * `/convert <unit expression> to <other unit>` does what you'd expect, also in the same style
       * Try `/convert 50 K to Fahrenheit`
 * Config has a list of units that we assign to either metric or imperial
